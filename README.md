## :moneybag: Bounty Pool
**10 Million Masa Tokens & $25k USDC**

10,000,000 Masa Tokens $MASA and $25,000 USDC are initially allocated to the Bug Bounty Pool. We calculated this using a ratio of MASA to USDC of 1/400 for rewards â€“ i.e. a Medium Risk bug would get 100,000 MASA and $250 USDC. Submissions will be rewarded based on Bug Bounty Tiers, except for the highest tier, which is for Critical Vulnerabilities and assessed on a case-by-case basis. Masa will communicate directly with the white-hat developer that identifies the vulnerability. A Critical Vulnerability is one where the risk of material loss to the protocol is over $100,000 in value.
