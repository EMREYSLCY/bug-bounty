We will update this repo once a month with a `.csv` of Bug Bounty participants who have qualified for the Bounty Pool. Bounty Pool payments will be made once the Masa token is live on the protocol which has not be announced yet. 

## :moneybag: Bounty Pool

**10,000,000 Masa Tokens $MASA** and **$25,000 USDC** are initially allocated to the Bug Bounty Pool. We calculated this using a ratio of MASA to USDC of 1/400 for rewards â€“ i.e. a Medium Risk bug would get 100,000 MASA and $250 USDC. Submissions will be rewarded based on Bug Bounty Tiers, except for the highest tier, which is for Critical Vulnerabilities and assessed on a case-by-case basis. Masa will communicate directly with the white-hat developer that identifies the vulnerability. A Critical Vulnerability is one where the risk of material loss to the protocol is over $100,000 in value.
